Hello, my name is Ryan Eades. I'm in Computer Science and Pure MaTHEMATICS. i'VE BEEN DRAGGED UNWILLINGLY TO SEVERAL HACKAThons and totally nailed CS230 freshman year. I don't want to put my hopes in here, because hope is something everyone always says is valuable in dire situations(get your own hope, thief). I have a lot of dreams that I'd be happy to provide upon request. I actually keep a little notebook beside my bed where I like to record those dreams after I wake up. Often I find that my dreams revolve around movies or tv shows I watch before I go to sleep. I try to keep the amount of jump scares to a minimum because of this. One time I watched the Dark Knight and at the time my dreams were all about the Joker. I don't think I dream of being him, just that he comes and murders me in my sleep.
recently, I've kept things a little bit lighter, TO HELP ME SLEEP BETTER. iT'S BEEn a good time. 
I'm not great at rap songs, but I guess I can try a little bit:You got it in a bag, you know you can't rap, buying clothes off of racks, can't even afford thumbtacks. Yo, yo, my name's the best. You ain't got to rest. I like cookies with lemon zest. I don't take tests, but I've never been arrest  -ted, cause then I'd be messed.... -with. Uh! Uh! Wacka wacka word.   (If that isn't blackbelt worthy, I don't know what is)
