// make the layout a grid with four rows and the number of columns equal to the number of pets


// for each pet, put its image, then the list of attributes, then the list of options for that attribute, then an "update object" button



// create an actionPerformed method that switches the second choice list based on which attribute is picked(i.e. don't show rankings of cleanliness when the attribute is hunger) When the button for that pet is clicked, it should change that pet's attribute value
