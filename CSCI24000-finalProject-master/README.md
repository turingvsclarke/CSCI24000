# Chromatic Polynomial Solver

Reason for this project: I created this project as a final project for a course. The course was the second of a two-part series taught on basic programming principles. This project demonstrates my thorough knowledge of Object-Oriented-Design principles and how that can be implemented using the Java language.

Running the program: ChromPolyGraph.jar
